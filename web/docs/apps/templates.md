App templates are a way to quickly get started with a new app. They are a collection of processors and models that are pre-configured to work together to solve a specific problem. They will have all the necessary prompts and wiring needed for the use case it attempts to solve. For example, the `Voice Summarizer` is a template that allows you to summarize text and read it out loud using a ElevenLab's text-to-speech model.

These templates expose certain configuration options that allow you to customize the behavior of the app. For example, the `Voice Summarizer` template allows you to choose the summarization model and the text-to-speech model.
